This plugin provides access to a range of free training videos for end users of WordPress. Access to the videos is from their WordPress Dashboard.

== Description ==

Provide users with a range of free video training materials covering basic operations in WordPress. 

The training material covers simple operations like the WordPress editor, pages, posts, plugins and more.

Developers are also able to customise the plugin by adding additional video or static content that can also be available to users right inside their WordPress Dashboard.

Videos are not stored in the plugin itself they are read in real time as the user requests a video tutorial, therefore the actual plugin is very small in size.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

From inside the WordPress admin interface you will then find a new set of options at the top -Help For WP-
